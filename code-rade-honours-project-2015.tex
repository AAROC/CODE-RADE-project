\section{Problem Statement}
One of the aims of e-Infrastructures is to provide easy access to powerful computational and data platforms, to as many eligible users as possible. The South African National Grid (SAGrid), as part of the National Integrated Cyberinfrastructure System is no exception. While access to the users is being simplified greatly by the adoption of science gateways and identity federations, the community of application developers and technical support in scientific collaborations does not yet have an easy way to integrate these applications in the first place.

SAGrid has identified this as a gap in the services it provides and has developed a solution to the issue of easily integrating new applications into the infrastructure in a fast, flexible, distributed and reproducible way. Using existing tools and services, we have defined a simple set of tests which applications need to pass in order to be considered valid for the infrastructure. These can been encoded as automated tests using a continuous integration platform such as Jenkins. Interoperability between source code repositories, automated build systems, artifact creation and content delivery systems is crucial for the sustainability and uptake of the system. 

The specific problems we aim to address in this limited-scope project are those of automation and distribution. Specifically 

\begin{itemize}
\item How far is it feasible to automate the bu
and how distribution of these applications has been simplified, compared to “traditional” means of deploying software on the grid and cloud. In particular, we will highlight the ease of collaboration. We thus describe a slightly different type of “science gateway”, relevant to application developers, which promotes collaboration, increases reproducibility of the work done, and ensures that there is a sustainable development of applications for Science Gateways connected to the African e-Infrastructure.
