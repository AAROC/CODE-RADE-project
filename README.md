# CORE-RADE Honours project

This is an **honours** project description submitted to the University of the Witwatersrand. The project proposal is written in LaTex, from an ERC starting grant template, because overkill is a thing.

If you want to contribute, note that the main author, @brucellino, is using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/krkmwfqzbtss) to write the project. You should push to the github repo, and these, if accepted will be pushed to the overleaf repo.

Hooray !
